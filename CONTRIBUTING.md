# Contributing

Thanks for helping out. Read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) first — swearing
about code is fine, swearing at people is not.

## How a change gets in

`main` is protected. Only the maintainers, @PhilippTheServer and @maltonoloco, can push
to it directly. Everyone else goes through a pull request:

1. **Open an issue** describing the behaviour you expect once it is solved. Small fixes
   too — it is where the discussion lives.
2. **Branch** from `main` (or fork, if you have no write access).
3. **Commit and push** your branch.
4. **Open a pull request** against `main` and link the issue with `Closes #N` in the
   body.
5. **CI must pass.** These checks are required before the PR can be merged:
   - `Wiki matches the API`
   - `Wiki.js stack serves the pages with no login`
6. **A maintainer must approve.** Every file is owned by @PhilippTheServer and
   @maltonoloco (see [.github/CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS)); one of them has to
   review and approve. New commits after an approval need a fresh approval.
7. **Squash merge.** The PR lands as a single commit on `main`; delete the branch
   afterwards.

## Before you open the PR

Run the same checks locally so CI has no surprises:

```sh
python3 tools/check_wiki.py
docker compose up -d db wiki && docker compose run --rm bootstrap
python3 tools/check_wikijs.py
```

Update the docs in the same PR as the change, not afterwards, and add a test that would
fail if your fix regressed.


## Repository Rules

- **No direct commits or pushes to `main`.** All changes go through a pull request.
- Open a PR against `main` for every change, then **squash-merge** it and **delete the branch** (locally and remotely).
- Commit messages use the format `<prefix>(feature): message` (imperative, concise, no trailing period).
